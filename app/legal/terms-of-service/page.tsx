          These Terms of Service (&quot;<strong>Terms</strong>&quot;) are a legal agreement
          between you and <strong>HFJO&amp;CO LIMITED</strong> (&quot;<strong>Lumii</strong>&quot;,
          &quot;<strong>we</strong>&quot;, &quot;<strong>us</strong>&quot; or &quot;<strong>our</strong>&quot;),
          a company registered in England &amp; Wales under company number{" "}
          <strong>15421741</strong>, with its registered office at{" "}
          <strong>167–169 Great Portland Street, 5th Floor, London W1W 5PF, United Kingdom</strong>.
          These Terms govern your use of the Lumii mobile application and any related services
          (together, the &quot;<strong>Service</strong>&quot;).
          {" "}By downloading, installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms and to our{" "}
          <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the App.
        </p>
      }
    >
      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use Lumii.</li>
        <li>If you are between 13 and 17, you should use Lumii only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. We do not currently operate an in-app parental-verification flow, see Section 11 of our <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> for how this works and how a parent or guardian can exercise rights on your behalf.</li>
        <li>You confirm that the information you provide when you sign up is accurate and that you are not barred from using the Service under any applicable law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may refuse, suspend or terminate accounts that do not meet these requirements.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>2. What Lumii does (and what it doesn&apos;t)</h2>
      <p>Lumii is a self-improvement app that uses computer vision and AI to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>analyse multi-angle photos of your face that you submit;</li>
        <li>give you a &quot;glow score&quot;, proportion and symmetry metrics, and a personalised routine; and</li>
        <li>track your progress over time, with optional goals, cycle logging and reminders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Lumii is for entertainment, self-care and personal-development purposes only.</strong>{" "}
        It is <strong>not</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>medical, dermatological, cosmetic-surgery, psychological or any other professional advice;</li>
        <li>a diagnostic tool of any kind;</li>
        <li>a substitute for consultation with a qualified healthcare or beauty professional.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have a medical or mental-health concern, speak to a qualified professional. If you are in
        crisis, call your local emergency services or a crisis line (in the UK, Samaritans on 116 123).
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>3. Your account</h2>
      <p>To use most of Lumii&apos;s features you need to create an account. You agree:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>to give us accurate, current information when you sign up;</li>
        <li>to keep your password confidential and not to share your account with anyone;</li>
        <li>that you are responsible for all activity on your account; and</li>
        <li>to tell us straight away if you think someone has accessed your account without permission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can delete your account at any time from the in-app{" "}
        <strong>Account → Delete account</strong> option. Deletion removes your profile and any data
        linked to your account from our systems; see the Privacy Policy for full retention details.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>4. Your photos and content</h2>

      <h3>4.1 You own your content</h3>
      <p>
        You keep all rights in the photos you submit and the content you create in the App (&quot;<strong>User Content</strong>&quot;).
        We do <strong>not</strong> claim ownership of any of it.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Licence to us</h3>
      <p>
        To run the App, we need a limited licence to handle your User Content. By using Lumii you grant
        us a <strong>worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence</strong> to host, store, copy,
        transmit, display and process your User Content solely to operate, provide and improve the
        Service for you. This licence ends when you delete the content or your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> use your photos to train third-party AI models. We do not sell your
        photos. We do not use your photos for advertising. We do not share your photos with anyone except
        the service providers listed in our Privacy Policy, and only where necessary to deliver the
        Service to you. Your actual photos are processed only by our own scoring backend. Other AI
        services we use (such as Anthropic&apos;s Claude API) receive only your scores and summary
        information, never the photos themselves.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Your warranties</h3>
      <p>You warrant that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the content you upload is of yourself, or you have the explicit consent of the person shown to upload and analyse it;</li>
        <li>you have all rights necessary to grant the licence in section 4.2;</li>
        <li>your content does not infringe anyone else&apos;s rights and is not illegal, abusive, defamatory, sexually explicit involving minors, or otherwise prohibited by section 5.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>5. Acceptable use</h2>
      <p>You agree <strong>not</strong> to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>upload photos of anyone other than yourself without their explicit, informed consent;</li>
        <li>upload nudity, sexually explicit content, content depicting minors in any inappropriate way, or any content that violates the law where you live or where we operate;</li>
        <li>use the App to harass, bully, dox, threaten, defame or discriminate against any person;</li>
        <li>impersonate another person or misrepresent your identity, age or affiliation;</li>
        <li>reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble or attempt to derive the source code of the App, except to the limited extent the law allows you to do so;</li>
        <li>use bots, scrapers, automated agents or AI tools to access the Service in ways that are not part of the normal user interface;</li>
        <li>circumvent any security, rate-limit, authentication or access-control feature of the App;</li>
        <li>probe, scan or test the vulnerability of our systems without our prior written consent;</li>
        <li>use the Service in any way that could damage, disable, overburden or impair it;</li>
        <li>attempt to game the referral or waitlist-code system (see Section 7.5 and 7.6), including by creating multiple accounts, using disposable email addresses or device emulators to generate referrals, or sharing your referral code in ways our anti-abuse rules prohibit; or</li>
        <li>use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in breach of these Terms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate your access, and we may reverse or refuse any promotional grant, if
        we reasonably believe you have breached these rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Reporting and moderation.</strong> Circle is not a place for abuse. Every shared post,
        comment and profile includes tools to <strong>block</strong> the person and to <strong>report</strong>{" "}
        the content to us with a reason. We review reports against these Terms and our content rules, and
        we may <strong>remove or hide content, warn, suspend, or permanently terminate</strong> any account
        we reasonably believe has breached the acceptable-use rules above, with or without notice. We aim
        to act promptly on reports of serious harm, such as sexual content involving minors, threats, or
        harassment. You can also reach our team at <strong>office@hfjo.co.uk</strong>.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>6. AI, analysis and body-image disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The scores, grades, proportion analyses and tips Lumii produces are generated by computer-vision
        algorithms and AI language models. They are inherently:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>probabilistic and approximate</strong>, results vary with lighting, photo quality, angle, expression and other factors;</li>
        <li><strong>not measurements of objective worth, beauty, health or attractiveness</strong>, they are pattern outputs based on a model we have trained;</li>
        <li><strong>not personalised medical or psychological advice</strong>, see section 2.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We have designed Lumii to feel supportive and to nudge healthy self-care behaviours. We strongly recommend you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>treat the scores as a fun, motivational tool rather than a verdict;</li>
        <li>stop using the App if it is harming your mental health or self-image;</li>
        <li>talk to a qualified professional if your relationship with your appearance becomes distressing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You agree that you will not make significant cosmetic, medical, surgical or mental-health
        decisions based solely on Lumii&apos;s outputs.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>7. Subscriptions and payments</h2>
      <p>
        Lumii offers an optional subscription called <strong>Lumii Pro</strong>, which unlocks the full
        feature set described inside the App.
      </p>

      <h3>7.1 Pricing and renewal</h3>
      <div className="legal-table">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Plan</th>
              <th>Price (UK)</th>
              <th>Billing</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Annual</td>
              <td><strong>£39.99 / year</strong></td>

            <tr>
              <td>Weekly (legacy)</td>
              <td><strong>£3.99 / week</strong></td>
              <td>No longer offered to new subscribers; existing weekly subscriptions continue to auto-renew unless cancelled</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>
        Regional pricing may vary based on Apple&apos;s local pricing tiers and any taxes Apple is
        required to collect. The exact price you will be charged is displayed inside the App before you
        confirm the purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subscriptions <strong>auto-renew</strong> at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at
        least <strong>24 hours before</strong> the end of the current period. Renewal is charged to your
        Apple ID payment method.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 How payment works</h3>
      <p>
        Payment is processed entirely by <strong>Apple In-App Purchase</strong> through the App Store.{" "}
        <strong>Lumii never receives or stores your payment card, bank account or other financial
        details.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We use <strong>RevenueCat, Inc.</strong> to verify your subscription status and apply
        promotional grants. RevenueCat receives your Lumii user ID and an anonymous Apple subscriber
        identifier (a randomised ID Apple gives to apps, not your Apple ID or your email). See our
        Privacy Policy for more on RevenueCat&apos;s role.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Managing or cancelling your subscription</h3>
      <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time from your device:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings → tap your name at the top → Subscriptions → Lumii.</li>
        <li><strong>inside the App:</strong> the Paywall screen has a &quot;Manage subscription&quot; link that opens the same iOS Subscriptions screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You keep Lumii Pro access until then.</p>

      <h3>7.4 Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Refunds are handled by <strong>Apple</strong> under the standard App Store Terms of Service. You
        can request a refund from Apple at <strong>reportaproblem.apple.com</strong>.{" "}
        <strong>Lumii cannot directly issue refunds for App Store purchases.</strong> Nothing in these
        Terms gives you any in-app refund right or grace-refund window beyond what Apple offers.
      </p>

      <h3>7.5 Referrals</h3>
      <p>
        When you create a Lumii account, we generate a 6-character referral code unique to you. If a
        friend signs up using your code and meets our validation rules below, you will receive a free
        14-day promotional grant of Lumii Pro for each validated friend.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What &quot;validated&quot; means.</strong> A referral is validated when the friend completes the in-app onboarding steps we require for a referral to count. We display the current requirements at the point of redemption, at the date of this version, this is signup and the first scan. We may change these requirements (within reason and with notice in this document) to deter fraud or abuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Maximum banked referrals.</strong> You can bank up to <strong>12 validated referrals</strong> at a time. We may temporarily raise or lower this cap to manage promotional periods or deter abuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-abuse.</strong> We may delay, decline or reverse a referral grant if we reasonably believe the referral was generated through fraud, multiple accounts, disposable emails, device emulators, code-sharing rings or any other abuse pattern. Rejection reasons we currently apply include: self-referral, code unknown or already redeemed, the bank cap, the friend not completing a scan, suspicious device fingerprinting, and rate limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Stacking.</strong> Promotional grants from referrals stack additively with each other and run consecutively. They do not extend or convert a paid subscription, and they do not auto-renew. When the grant period ends, your account returns to the free tier unless you have an active paid subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Promotional grants are not purchases.</strong> A referral grant is delivered as a <strong>promotional entitlement through RevenueCat</strong>. It is <strong>not</strong> an Apple In-App Purchase, you are <strong>not charged</strong>, and your Apple ID is not billed.</li>
        <li><strong>We can change or end the referral program</strong> at any time with reasonable notice through the App or by email. Banked grants that have already been validated will be honoured.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7.6 Waitlist founding-member codes</h3>
      <p>
        A limited number of LUMI-XXXX codes were distributed to our pre-launch waitlist. Each code is{" "}
        <strong>single-use</strong> and grants the redeemer a fixed-duration promotional entitlement to
        Lumii Pro. Once a code is redeemed, it cannot be redeemed again. We may decline a code that has
        been redeemed, that is suspected to have been improperly distributed, or that was issued in
        error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waitlist codes are also promotional entitlements delivered through RevenueCat, they are not
        Apple In-App Purchases and do not charge you.
      </p>

      <h3>7.7 Changes to pricing or plans</h3>
      <p>
        We may change Lumii Pro pricing, plans or features. If a change increases the recurring price you
        pay, we will give you reasonable notice (through the App and / or by email) before the next
        renewal so you can cancel if you wish. Apple may require its own confirmation of price increases
        under App Store rules.
      </p>

        intellectual-property laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        We grant you a <strong>personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-exclusive licence</strong> to

      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>9. Third-party services</h2>
      <p>
        The App relies on third-party services (listed in our Privacy Policy) to operate. Your use of
        those services through Lumii is also subject to their own terms. We are not responsible for the
        acts, omissions or content of third parties, and we make no warranties about their services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The App may include links to third-party websites or videos (for example, YouTube tutorials).
        Following those links is at your own risk.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided{" "}
        <strong>&quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot;</strong>, without warranties of any kind,
        express or implied. We do not warrant that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free;</li>
        <li>the scores, tips or analyses will be accurate, complete or suitable for any particular purpose;</li>
        <li>any defects will be corrected; or</li>
        <li>the Service will meet your expectations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nothing in this section limits any rights you have under the UK Consumer Rights Act 2015 or any
        other mandatory consumer-protection laws that apply to you.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary loss or damage; lost profits; lost revenues; lost data; lost goodwill; or business interruption, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.</li>
        <li>Our total aggregate liability to you for all claims arising out of or relating to the Service in any 12-month period is limited to the greater of (a) the amount you have paid us for the Service in that period or (b) £50.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>death or personal injury caused by our negligence;</li>
        <li>fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or</li>
        <li>any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer based in the UK or EU, these limits apply only to the extent permitted by
        your local consumer-protection laws, and your statutory rights are unaffected.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>12. Indemnity</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Lumii, its
        owners, employees, contractors and agents from and against any claim, liability, loss or expense
        (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of:
      </p>
      <ul>

      <p>
        This section does not apply to claims that arise from our own breach of these Terms, our
        negligence or our wilful misconduct, and it applies only to the extent permitted by your local
        consumer-protection laws.

      <hr />

      <h2>13. Suspension and termination</h2>

        <li>we discontinue all or part of the Service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You may terminate these Terms at any time by deleting your account and uninstalling the App.

        liability, indemnity and governing law) will survive.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>14. Changes to the Service</h2>
      <p>
        We may add, change, suspend or remove features of the Service at any time. We will give you

      <hr />

      <h2>15. Changes to these Terms</h2>

        &quot;Last Updated&quot; date and notify you through the App or by email of the change. Your
        continued use of the Service after the new Terms take effect means you accept the new Terms. If
        you do not agree, you must stop using the Service and delete your account.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>16. Governing law and disputes</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms and any non-contractual obligations arising out of them are governed by the{" "}

      <p>
        You and we agree that the courts of England and Wales will have{" "}
        <strong>exclusive jurisdiction</strong> to settle any dispute arising under these Terms, except
        that:
      </p>

        <li>if you are a consumer resident in another part of the UK (Scotland or Northern Ireland), you may bring proceedings in the courts of that part; and</li>
        <li>if you are a consumer resident in the EU, you can bring proceedings in your country of residence and you may benefit from mandatory consumer-protection provisions of your local law.</li>

      <h2>17. App-store specific terms</h2>
