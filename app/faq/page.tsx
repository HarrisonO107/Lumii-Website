        q: "What is Lumii?",
        a: "Lumii is an AI-powered beauty advisor that analyses your face to give you a personalised Glow Score and skincare routine. Upload a photo, and our engine maps 584 facial landmarks and scores 75+ metrics, texture, tone, symmetry, hydration, and more, to build a routine designed specifically for your skin.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is Lumii a dermatologist?",
        a: "No. Lumii is an AI tool for self-knowledge and skincare guidance, not a medical device. Our model has been validated against dermatologist assessments with 89% concordance, but it does not replace professional medical advice. If you have skin concerns, please consult a dermatologist.",
      },
      {
        q: "When is Lumii launching?",
        a: "Lumii is live now on iOS, download it free on the App Store. Android is in development; join the waitlist and we'll email you the moment it launches.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will Lumii be free?",
        a: "Lumii is free to download and use on iOS. There's an optional Lumii Pro subscription (£3.99/week or £39.99/year) that unlocks advanced features like progress tracking and detailed product recommendations.",

    category: "Privacy & Data",

      {
        q: "Does Lumii store my photos?",
        a: "Your face photos are uploaded to our server only to be analysed, then automatically deleted within 24 hours of upload. We never sell them, share them with advertisers, or use them to train any third-party AI model.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my data safe?",
        a: "Yes. We only store your email address (to send your waitlist confirmation and launch notification) and your Glow Score history, not the photos used to generate it. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you sell my data?",
        a: "Never. We will not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for advertising or any other commercial purpose.",

  {
    category: "Analysis",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How accurate is the AI analysis?",
        a: "Our model has been validated against expert dermatologist assessments with 89% concordance across key skin metrics. Accuracy improves with photo quality, clear lighting and no filters give the best results.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will it work on my skin tone?",
        a: "Yes. Lumii is trained on diverse skin tones across all six Fitzpatrick types, and we run quarterly bias audits to ensure accuracy is consistent regardless of skin tone or ethnicity. We take this seriously and actively address any imbalances found.",
      },
      {
        q: "What makes a good photo for analysis?",
        a: "Use natural lighting, face the camera straight on, and remove heavy makeup if possible. Avoid strong filters. A simple, well-lit selfie gives the most accurate results.",
      },
      {
        q: "How often should I scan?",
        a: "We recommend scanning once a week or once a fortnight. Skin changes slowly, so daily scans won't show meaningful differences. Weekly scans are ideal for tracking how your routine is working.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Routines",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How does Lumii build my routine?",
        a: "Based on your scan results, skin type, undertone, key concerns, Glow Score breakdown, Lumii assembles a morning and evening routine using evidence-backed ingredients and steps. The routine is ordered correctly (active ingredients, barriers, SPF) and accounts for compatibility between ingredients.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will Lumii recommend specific products?",
        a: "At launch, Lumii provides ingredient-level guidance and product type recommendations. Specific product recommendations (with links) are coming in a future update. We are building this independently, brands cannot pay to be recommended.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I'm a beginner?",
        a: "Lumii is designed for all experience levels. If you're new to skincare, your routine will be simple and clearly explained. More experienced users will receive more nuanced guidance including scheduling for actives like retinol and exfoliants.",
